One of the first problems youâ€™ll encounter in data engineering is Word Count, which takes in a text file or set of text files from a directory and outputs the number of occurrences for each word.

The first part of the coding challenge is to implement your own version of Word Count that counts all the words from the text files contained in a directory named wc_input and outputs the counts (in alphabetical order) to a file named wc_result.txt, which is placed in a directory named wc_output.
