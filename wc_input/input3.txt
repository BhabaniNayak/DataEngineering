Another common problem is the Running Median-which keeps track of the median for a stream of numbers, updating the median for each new number. The second part of the coding challenge is to implement a running median for the number of words per line of text. Consider each line in a text file as a new stream of words, and find the median number of words per line, up to that point (i.e. the median for that line and all the previous lines).

We'd like you to implement your own version of this running median that calculates the median number of words per line, for each line of the text files in the wc_input directory. If there are multiple files in that directory, the files should be combined into a single stream and processed by your running median program in alphabetical order, so a file named hello.txt should be processed before a file named world.txt. The resulting running median for each line should then be outputted to a text file named med_result.txt in the wc_output directory.
